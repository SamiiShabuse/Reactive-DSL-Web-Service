# 🚀 “Reactive DSL Web Service” Project

## What it combines:

- DSL Design + Compiler → use Racket’s macro system and #lang

- Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) → via Racket’s FRP libraries

- Real‑world Web Service → using Racket's web-server

- Static Analysis / Safety Checks → ensures robustness

## Restrictions

- Can only work on this project during CS360 Lecture

- Must aim for code being 90% done in Racket 
    - May adjust this number when necessary

- Must learn something and document what I learn.
